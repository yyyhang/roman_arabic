# roman arabic convert

First, this program can convert a strictly positive integer to a Roman number or a Roman number to a strictly positive integer. 

Besides, it can convert a strictly positive integer (whose representation should not start with 0) or a sequence of 
(lowercase or uppercase) letters using a sequence of distinct (lowercase or uppercase) letters that you give. 

On the top of that, another function is the program can try and view a sequence of (lowercase or uppercase) letters that you
give as a generalised Roman number with respect to some sequence of generalised Roman symbols.

If that is not possible, then the program will stop, otherwise, the program will find the smallest integer that could be 
converted from the sequence of letters, viewed as some generalised Roman number, to Arabic.
